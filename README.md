# House Rules 5e
This repo contains house rules for my regular DnD 5e group.

## Campaigns

| Rule Name            | Chultan Imprisonment | Moonshae Isles |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Stacking Proficiency | YES                  | ?              |

## Rules

### Stacking Proficiency (on Tools and Instruments)

If a (player) character has **two proficiencies** for specific **tool or instrument** roll, they get their proficiency bonus just once (as per the normal PHB rules), but they additionally get **advantage**.

Examples:
  - A character proficient in *Thieves Tools* and *Sleight of Hand* will get **advantage** if picking a lock.
  - A character proficient in *Performance* and the *Viol* will get **advantage** on performing with a viol.
  - While a character, who is proficient in *Deception*, but not with the *Forgery Kit*, will **not** get an advantage.
