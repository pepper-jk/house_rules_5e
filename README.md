## Rules

### Additional (flavor) Proficiency

After the addtion of [pirate weapons](https://www.tribality.com/2016/01/22/weapons-for-a-dd-5e-pirate-campaign-setting/), which weren't available at the start of the campaign. We decided to allow each player to take a new proficiency.

Either one of the pirate weapons or another flavored proficiency in weapons, tools or instruments.
These ranged from the tools used in the sailing rules from Ghost of Saltmarch, over instruments, which could be used to amuse the ships crew, up to tools and weapons, which had the same pirate or naval flavor.

Examples: Viol, Dragon Pistol, Carpenting Tools and Longbow.

### Cardic Inspiration

> inspired by Arcane Arcade

Each session each player may draw from the deck of cardic inspiration and add its value to a ability check, saving throw or attack roll, either of themselves or of a fellow player.

Any image card has the value 10 and a number just has the value it represents.
An Ace counts as the value 20, but overwrites your roll.

### Crunchy Crits

When scoring a critical hit, you add max damage to your roll instead of rolling the dice double.

### Fluid Level Up

Each time a player character gains a level, they may change one of their spells (including cantrips), battle master maneuvers or an option from a similar mechanic.

### Lucky Feat

If you use the Lucky Feat while rolling with disadvantage, you gain a **third roll**, but you **must take** it no matter the result. You **can not** take either of the rolls done with disadvantage.

### Saving a drowning creature

To save an unconscious creature that is drowning, you must bring it back to the surface. To grab the creature you must make a Stregth(Athletics) Skill Check. The DC depends on the armor type and scales with the size of the drowning creature. For each size category smaller than Medium subtract 2 and for each size category larger than Medium add 2.

| Armor Type   | DC |
|--------------|----|
| no armor     | 12 |
| light armor  | 13 |
| medium armor | 14 |
| heavy armor  | 15 |

### Sinking

If an swimming creature falls unconscious, it starts sinking. It sinks closer to the bottom of the water at the end of each of its turns. Its speed is determined by its armor type:

| Armor Type   | Speed  |
|--------------|--------|
| light armor  | 5 ft.  |
| medium armor | 10 ft. |
| heavy armor  | 15 ft. |

### Stacking Proficiency (on Tools and Instruments)

If a (player) character has **two proficiencies** for a specific **tool or instrument** roll, they get their proficiency bonus just once (as per the normal PHB rules), but they additionally get **advantage**.

Examples:
  - A character proficient in *Thieves Tools* and *Sleight of Hand* will get **advantage** if picking a lock.
  - A character proficient in *Performance* and the *Viol* will get **advantage** on performing with a viol.
  - While a character, who is proficient in *Deception*, but not with the *Forgery Kit*, will **not** get an advantage.

### True Strike

**No concentration.** In addition to gaining advantage on your next weapon attack you also gain 1d6 damage of the type of out weapon on that attack if it hits.

### Warlock Spell Storing

If a warlock casts a spell into a ring of spell storing, they can try to store the spell at base level.
However, they need to succeed an Intelligence (Arcana) check to do so.
The DC for the spell is 10 + the level at which they would cast the spell - the base level of the spell.

If a warlock casts a spell in this way, they still expend a spell slot as they would normally.
