## Rules

### Stacking Proficiency (on Tools and Instruments)

If a (player) character has **two proficiencies** for a specific **tool or instrument** roll, they get their proficiency bonus just once (as per the normal PHB rules), but they additionally get **advantage**.

Examples:
  - A character proficient in *Thieves Tools* and *Sleight of Hand* will get **advantage** if picking a lock.
  - A character proficient in *Performance* and the *Viol* will get **advantage** on performing with a viol.
  - While a character, who is proficient in *Deception*, but not with the *Forgery Kit*, will **not** get an advantage.

### Additional (flavor) Proficiency

After the addtion of [pirate weapons](https://www.tribality.com/2016/01/22/weapons-for-a-dd-5e-pirate-campaign-setting/), which weren't available at the start of the campaign. We decided to allow each player to take a new proficiency.

Either one of the pirate weapons or another flavored proficiency in weapons, tools or instruments.
These ranged from the tools used in the sailing rules from Ghost of Saltmarch, over instruments, which could be used to amuse the ships crew, up to tools and weapons, which had the same pirate or naval flavor.

Examples: Viol, Dragon Pistol, Carpenting Tools and Longbow.
